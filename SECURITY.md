## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of this project seriously.  
If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.  

Instead, report it directly by emailing:  
📧 **anitherock44@gmail.com**

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**, and you can expect a more detailed response within **5 business days**, including a timeline for a fix.

## Disclosure Policy
- We ask that you keep vulnerabilities and security issues private until they are fixed.  
- Coordinated disclosure ensures users have time to update and are not exposed to active exploits.  
- Once resolved, we will publish a **Security Advisory** on GitHub to document the fix.
