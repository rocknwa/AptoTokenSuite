# üîê Security Guide

This document outlines security best practices and considerations for your Aptos token contract.

## üö® Critical Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] **Private Key Security**: Never commit private keys to version control
- [ ] **Test Thoroughly**: Run comprehensive tests on testnet before mainnet deployment
- [ ] **Code Review**: Have experienced developers review your contract code
- [ ] **Audit**: Consider professional audit for high-value contracts
- [ ] **Upgrade Policy**: Choose appropriate upgrade policy for your use case

### Access Control

- [ ] **Admin Functions**: Verify only admin can mint/burn tokens
- [ ] **Function Visibility**: Ensure proper `public`, `public(friend)`, and private visibility
- [ ] **Resource Protection**: Use `acquires` properly for resource access
- [ ] **Capability Storage**: Store capabilities securely in admin account

### Token Economics

- [ ] **Supply Controls**: Implement maximum supply if needed
- [ ] **Burn Mechanisms**: Ensure burn functions work correctly
- [ ] **Overflow Protection**: Use checked arithmetic where appropriate
- [ ] **Transfer Validation**: Validate all transfer operations

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### 1. Access Control Patterns

#### Admin-Only Functions
```move
public entry fun admin_only_function(admin: &signer) acquires TokenCapabilities {
    let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
    assert!(exists<TokenCapabilities>(admin_addr), E_NOT_ADMIN);
    // Function logic here
}
```

#### Multi-Signature Pattern
```move
struct MultiSigConfig has key {
    required_signatures: u8,
    signers: vector<address>,
}

public entry fun multi_sig_function(
    signers: vector<&signer>,
    // other parameters
) acquires MultiSigConfig {
    let config = borrow_global<MultiSigConfig>(@module_address);
    assert!(vector::length(&signers) >= (config.required_signatures as u64), E_INSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES);
    // Validate signers and execute function
}
```

### 2. Input Validation

#### Always Validate Amounts
```move
public entry fun transfer(from: &signer, to: address, amount: u64) {
    assert!(amount > 0, E_INVALID_AMOUNT);
    assert!(to != @0x0, E_INVALID_ADDRESS);
    // Transfer logic
}
```

#### Check Account Registration
```move
public entry fun mint(admin: &signer, to: address, amount: u64) {
    assert!(coin::is_account_registered<MyToken>(to), E_ACCOUNT_NOT_REGISTERED);
    // Mint logic
}
```

### 3. Resource Management

#### Proper Resource Handling
```move
public fun withdraw(account: &signer, amount: u64): Coin<MyToken> {
    // Always check balance before withdrawal
    assert!(balance(signer::address_of(account)) >= amount, E_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE);
    coin::withdraw<MyToken>(account, amount)
}
```

#### Safe Resource Storage
```move
public entry fun store_capabilities(admin: &signer, caps: TokenCapabilities) {
    // Ensure only called during initialization
    assert!(!exists<TokenCapabilities>(signer::address_of(admin)), E_ALREADY_INITIALIZED);
    move_to(admin, caps);
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Vulnerabilities

### 1. Integer Overflow/Underflow
```move
// ‚ùå Vulnerable
let result = a + b; // Could overflow

// ‚úÖ Safe
let result = a + b;
assert!(result >= a, E_OVERFLOW); // Check for overflow
```

### 2. Reentrancy
```move
// ‚ùå Vulnerable pattern
public entry fun vulnerable_function(account: &signer) {
    external_call(); // Could reenter
    update_state(); // State changed after external call
}

// ‚úÖ Safe pattern
public entry fun safe_function(account: &signer) {
    update_state(); // Update state first
    external_call(); // Then make external calls
}
```

### 3. Access Control Bypass
```move
// ‚ùå Weak access control
public entry fun mint(account: &signer, amount: u64) {
    // Missing admin check!
    coin::mint(amount, &mint_cap);
}

// ‚úÖ Proper access control
public entry fun mint(admin: &signer, to: address, amount: u64) acquires TokenCapabilities {
    let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
    assert!(exists<TokenCapabilities>(admin_addr), E_NOT_ADMIN);
    // Mint logic
}
```

## üîí Private Key Management

### Development Environment
- Use separate keys for development and production
- Never commit private keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure key management systems
- Rotate keys regularly

### Production Environment
- Use hardware wallets for mainnet deployments
- Implement multi-signature wallets for high-value contracts
- Store backup keys in secure, offline locations
- Document key recovery procedures

## üõ°Ô∏è Contract Upgrade Security

### Upgrade Policy Considerations
```toml
# Conservative (recommended for most tokens)
upgrade_policy = "compatible"

# Most secure (cannot be upgraded)
upgrade_policy = "immutable"
```

### Safe Upgrade Practices
1. **Test Upgrades**: Always test on testnet first
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Consider phased deployment
3. **Backup State**: Always backup contract state before upgrades
4. **Monitor After Upgrade**: Watch for issues post-deployment
5. **Have Rollback Plan**: Prepare for potential issues

## üîç Monitoring and Alerting

### What to Monitor
- Large token transfers
- Unusual minting patterns
- Admin function calls
- Contract balance changes
- Failed transactions

### Alerting Setup
```bash
# Example monitoring script integration
./scripts/monitor.sh | grep "ALERT" | mail -s "Token Alert" admin@yourproject.com
```

2. **Document**: Record all details about the vulnerability
3. **Contain**: If possible, pause affected functions
4. **Fix**: Develop and test a fix
5. **Deploy**: Upgrade the contract if possible
6. **Communicate**: Inform stakeholders appropriately

### Emergency Procedures
```move
// Emergency pause mechanism
struct EmergencyState has key {
    is_paused: bool,
    admin: address,
}

public entry fun emergency_pause(admin: &signer) acquires EmergencyState {
    let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
    let emergency_state = borrow_global_mut<EmergencyState>(@module_address);
    assert!(emergency_state.admin == admin_addr, E_NOT_ADMIN);
    emergency_state.is_paused = true;
}
```
